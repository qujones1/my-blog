The current state of modern music is basically corporations and labels shelling out money to sell you on generic sounds from heavily branded and marketed inviduals. Or, independent artists not making their revenue from the art but instead a pyramid scheme in which they sell you thier sound and tools so you can attempt to sound like them and repeat the cycle of generic music.

**Originality** is dead and we are all just hearing the same music over and over again. This has always been the case to some extent but the internet has perpetuated this concept even greater, and instead of platforms and forums providing a place for unique content to flourish, the AI most users refer to as "the algorithm" propells the same sound to the top. Which is the intention of the programming, but is not in the best interest of all users.

Perhaps one day a platform will exist that breaks this tradition, until then this is the current state of modern music we live in.
